# NumericalAnalysis-MATH3383

The course provided me with techniques for numerical solutions to various mathematical problems. 
The main topics to be discussed include finding roots of nonlinear equations, approximating functions
by polynomials, integrating and differentiating functions, and their applications. The course also
provides me with skills for writing short matlab programs to test algorithms that
will be discussed in class. We shall cover the following topics of the the text book.
